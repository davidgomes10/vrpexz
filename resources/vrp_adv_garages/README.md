# vrp_adv_garages
## vRPex only

This script is not easy to be configured, please pay atention to the cfg file and read every commentary on it.  

This replaces the basic_garages from vRP. It's about the same code but modified to accept multiple garage types for each garage.  

Since this replaces the vRP garages comment your cfg.garages list in vRP.  

I'd like to thank: Lee Fall, Levy, Shadow, Anark, Eulogies, Vanyangel, anon and many others for their ideas, sugestions, and any other help they provided, without them none of my scripts would be possible.
