# vrp_basic_menu
fx-server only

The vrp_basic_menu is an interface for you to create menus and buttons with some example features included, and I'm always adding more, but the main purpose of it is for you to have a tool to create your own static menus and buttons without changing the source code of vRP.

Check the cfg/buttons to create buttons on the respective menu files, to add them to menus go on cfg/menus.  
Everything in the cfg should be checked out.

Good luck.
Feel free to mail me if you have more questions.
